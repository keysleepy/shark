                    <p>Despite surviving for over 450 million years, sharks now face their greatest threat: humans. An estimated 100 million sharks are killed annually, primarily due to fishing practices and demand for shark fins.</p>

                                <p>The practice of removing shark fins and discarding the rest of the shark at sea. Shark fin soup is considered a delicacy in some cultures, driving this cruel practice.</p>

                <p>For centuries, sharks have been misunderstood and feared. Popular media has often portrayed them as mindless killing machines, but the reality is far different. Let's separate fact from fiction.</p>

                        <p>Sharks rarely attack humans, and when they do, it's usually a case of mistaken identity. Most sharks are not interested in humans as prey. On average, there are only 5-10 fatal shark attacks worldwide each year, compared to the millions of people who enter the ocean.</p>

                        <h3>Cultural Legacy</h3>
                        <p>The portrayal of sharks in media has had real-world consequences. Negative depictions have contributed to fear and misunderstanding, while more recent educational efforts have helped improve public perception. Many shark researchers cite "Jaws" or "Shark Week" as their initial inspiration, showing that even sensationalized content can spark genuine interest in marine biology.</p>
